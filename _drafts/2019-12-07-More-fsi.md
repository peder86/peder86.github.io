### Final bits
For completeness, here are additional helper functions that I've added to my `prelude.fsx` which come in very handy from time to time. Note that I have only tested these on Windows

```fsharp
open System
open System.IO
open System.Diagnostics
open System.Globalization

/// Start a new process for the path.
let run path = Process.Start(fileName = path) |> ignore

/// Open this file for editing.
let editPrelude() =
  let scriptPath = Path.Combine(__SOURCE_DIRECTORY__, __SOURCE_FILE__)
  printfn "Opening %s for editing." scriptPath
  run scriptPath

/// Copies the item into the clipboard formatted as a string.
let clip obj =
  let text =
    match box obj with
    | :? String as s -> s
    | :? DateTime as s ->
      s.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)
    | _ -> sprintf "%A" obj
  if text = "" then
    printfn "No content, clipboard remains unchanged"
  else
    Windows.Forms.Clipboard.SetText(text, Windows.Forms.TextDataFormat.Text)
    printfn "Copied %i characters to clip board" text.Length
  obj
```
