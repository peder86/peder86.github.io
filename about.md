I'm a software developer lucky enough to work with `F#` in my day job. The purpose of this blog is to share my experience with functional programming in the real world.

This blog is created using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. The theme is [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima){:target="_blank"}.
